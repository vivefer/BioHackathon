This repositary is to store all of codes for the Project MutraSuchak made in Biohackathon, Kathmandu University as Team called CryoSages.

Following are all the reference papers, we used for Literature Review.


Here are the references for the research papers discussed regarding the development of Aβ1-42 biosensors using the cMIP method, formatted in APA style:
